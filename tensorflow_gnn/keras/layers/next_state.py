"""The NextState layers.

The NextState layers encapsulate various ways in which the state on an EdgeSet,
a NodeSet or the Context can be computed from its old state (if any) and
various side inputs. Typically, these NextState layers are passed to the
initializer of an EdgeSetUpdate, NodeSetUpdate or ContextUpdate layer.
For example, users of a NodeSetUpdate can choose between a SimpleStateUpdate
with a feed-forward network and a SkipConnectionStateUpdate that adds a
skip connection from the old to the new state.

Users of the TF-GNN library can define their own NextState layers.
Any Keras layer that can be called like the following prototypical examples
can be used as a NextState layer; it is not required to inherit from a
particular base class other than tf.keras.layers.Layer.

The input to a NextState layer is a tuple of three nests of tensors, all shaped
like features of the updated graph piece, and all meant to be included in the
computation of the next state. (The caller needs to pick the right inputs and
pool or broadcast them, as needed, before passing them to a NextState layer.)

The first position in the tuple has the inputs from the updated graph piece
itself, either a single tensor or a dict of tensors keyed by feature names.
It depends on the particular NextState layer whether it distinguishes further
between the tensor(s) with the state of the updated graph piece and other
features of it.

The second and third positions on the tuple hold nests of tensors with inputs
from the other related graph pieces. The exact format varies between edge sets,
node sets and context (see below). For each related graph piece, there is
either a single feature or a dict of features.

```python
class NextStateForEdgeSet(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def call(self, inputs: Tuple[
      FieldOrFields, # From the edges themselves.
      Mapping[IncidentNodeTag, FieldOrFields],  # From incident nodes.
      FieldOrFields]]  # From context.
  ) -> FieldOrFields:
    edge_input, incident_node_inputs, context_input = inputs
    raise NotImplementedError()

class NextStateForNodeSet(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def call(self, inputs: Tuple[
      FieldOrFields,  # From the nodes themselves.
      Mapping[EdgeSetName, FieldOrFields],  # From the incident edges.
      FieldOrFields]  # From context.
  ) -> FieldOrFields:
    node_input, edge_inputs, context_input = inputs
    raise NotImplementedError()

class NextStateForContext(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  def call(self, inputs: Tuple[
      FieldOrFields,  # From context itself.
      Mapping[NodeSetName, FieldOrFields],  # From nodes.
      Mapping[EdgeSetName, FieldOrFields]]  # From edges.
  ) -> FieldOrFields:
    context_input, node_inputs, edge_inputs = inputs
    raise NotImplementedError()
```

A NextState layer that only cares about the distinction between the updated
graph piece and all others, but not whether the updated graph piece is
an EdgeSet, a NodeSet or the Context, can conform to all three prototypes
as follows:

```python
class NextState(NextStateForEdgeSet, NextStateForNodeSet, NextStateForContext):
  def call(self, inputs: Tuple[
      FieldOrFields,  # From the updated graph piece.
      FieldsNest, FieldsNest]  # From related graph pieces of other types.
  ) -> FieldOrFields:
    self_inputs, *other_inputs = inputs
    flat_other_inputs = tf.nest.flatten(other_inputs)
    raise NotImplementedError("add implementation here")
```

The names of the prototypical classes above are used in type annotations
for the benefit of human readers, but pytype cannot actually check the
interface requirements beyond being any Keras layer.

  that modifies the state. The output shape of the residual block must match
  the shape of the state that gets updated so that they can be added.

  If the initial state of the graph piece that is being updated has size 0,
  the skip connection is omitted. This avoids the need to special-case, say,
  latent node sets in modeling code applied to different node sets.

      the residual block and the addition. If using this, typically the
      residual block does not have an activation function on its last layer,
