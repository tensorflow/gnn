  Based off of https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491, the GATv2 brings strict
  improvements over the original GAT (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) by
  allowing the network to compute a more expressived "dynamic" instead of
  just "static" attention. See the above papers for more details.

  This implementation of GAT attends only to edges that are explicitly stored

    Like the Keras Dense module, if the input features have rank greater than 2,

    values.

        stored in the returned GraphTensor.
      use_bias: If true, add a bias term to the transformation of the input
        features. For consistency with the GATv2 paper's code at

          a bias term is not used in the attention weights.
      edge_dropout: The percentage (between 0 and 1) of edges to randomly drop
        during training.
      attention_activation: The nonlinearity used on the transformed inputs
        before multiplying with the trained weights of the attention layer.
