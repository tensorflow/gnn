<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

A GraphTensor is an immutable container (as any composite tensor) to represent
one or more heterogeneous directed graphs, as defined in the GraphTensor guide
(or even hypergraphs). A GraphTensor consists of NodeSets, EdgeSets and a
Context (collectively known as graph pieces), which are also composite
tensors. The graph pieces consist of fields, which are `tf.Tensor`s and/or
`tf.RaggedTensor`s that store the graph structure (esp. the edges between
nodes) and user-defined features.

In the same way as `tf.Tensor` has numbers as its elements, the elements of
the GraphTensor are graphs. Its `shape` of `[]` describes a scalar (single)
graph, a shape of `[d0]` describes a `d0`-vector of graphs, a shape of
`[d0, d1]` a `d0` x `d1` matrix of graphs, and so on.

RULE: In the shape of a GraphTensor, no dimension except the outermost is
allowed to be `None` (that is, of unknown size). Future versions of
GraphTensor may lift that requirement.

Each of those graphs in a GraphTensor consists of 0 or more disjoint
(sub-)graphs called graph components. The number of components could vary
from graph to graph or be fixed to a value known statically. On a batched
GraphTensor, one can call the method merge_batch_to_components() to merge all
graphs of the batch into one, contiguously indexed graph containing the same
components as the original graph tensor. See the GraphTensor guide for the
typical usage that has motivated this design (going from input graphs with one
component each to a batch of input graphs and on to one merged graph with
multiple components for use in GNN model).

#### Example 1:



```python
# A homogeneous scalar graph tensor with 1 graph component, 10 nodes and 3
# edges. Edges connect nodes 0 and 3, 5 and 7, 9 and 1. There are no features.
tfgnn.GraphTensor.from_pieces(
    node_sets = {
      'node': tfgnn.NodeSet.from_fields(sizes=[10], features={})},
    edge_sets = {
      'edge': tfgnn.EdgeSet.from_fields(
         sizes=[3],
         features={},
         adjacency=tfgnn.Adjacency.from_indices(
           source=('node', [0, 5, 9]),
           target=('node', [3, 7, 1])))})
```

All graph pieces provide a mapping interface to access their features by name
as `graph_piece[feature_name]`. Each graph piece feature has the shape
`[*graph_shape, num_items, *feature_shape]`, where `graph_shape` is the shape
of the GraphTensor, `num_items` is the number of items in a piece (number of
graph components, number of nodes in a node set or edges in an edge set). The
`feature_shape` is the shape of the feature value for each item.

Naturally, the first <a href="../tfgnn/Adjacency.md#rank"><code>GraphTensor.rank</code></a> dimensions of all graph tensor fields
must index the same graphs, the item dimension must correspond to the same
item (graph component, node or edge) within the same graph piece (context,
node set or edge set).

RULE: 'None' always denotes ragged or outer most field dimension. Uniform
dimensions must have a fixed size that is given in the dimension.

In particular this rule implies that if a feature has `tf.Tensor` type its
`feature_shape` must by fully defined.

#### Example 2:



```python
# A scalar graph tensor with edges between authors, papers and their venues
# (journals or conferences). Each venue belongs to one graph component. The
# 1st venue (1980519) has 2 authors and 3 papers.
# The 2nd venue (9756463) has 2 authors and 1 paper.
# The paper 0 is written by authors 0 and 2; paper 1 - by authors 0 and 1;
# paper 2 - by author 2; paper 3 - by author 3.
venues = tfgnn.GraphTensor.from_pieces(
    context=tfgnn.Context.from_fields(
        features={'venue': [1980519, 9756463]}),
    node_sets={
        'author': tfgnn.NodeSet.from_fields(sizes=[2, 2], features={}),
        'paper': tfgnn.NodeSet.from_fields(
            sizes=[3, 1], features={'year': [2018, 2017, 2017, 2022]})},
    edge_sets={
        'is_writen': tfgnn.EdgeSet.from_fields(
            sizes=[4, 2],
            features={},
            adjacency=tfgnn.Adjacency.from_indices(
                source=('paper', [0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 3]),
                target=('author', [0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3])))})
```

The assignment of an item to its graph components is stored as the `sizes`
attribute of the graph piece. Its shape is `[*graph_shape, num_components]`
(the same for all pieces). The stored values are number of items in each graph
component (so the `.sizes` has all 1s as its values).

#### Example 3:



```python
# The year of publication of the first article in each venue from the
# previous example.
papers = venues.node_sets['paper']
years_by_venue = tf.RaggedTensor.from_row_lengths(papers['year'],
                                                  papers.sizes)
first_paper_year = tf.reduce_min(years_by_venue, -1)  # [2017, 2022]
```

The GraphTensor, as a composite tensor, can be used directly in a
tf.data.Dataset, as an input or output of a Keras Layer or a tf.function,
and so on. As any other tensor, the GraphTensor has an associated type
specification object, a GraphTensorSpec, that holds the `tf.TensorSpec` and
`tf.RaggedTensorSpec` objects for all its fields, plus a bit of metadata such
as graph connectivity (see tfgnn.GraphTensorSpec).

The GraphTensor allows batching of graphs. Batching changes a GraphTensor
instance's shape to `[batch_size, *graph_shape]` and the GraphTensor's
rank is increased by 1. Unbatching removes dimension-0, as if truncating with
`shape[1:]`, and the GraphTensor's rank is decreased by 1. This works
naturally with the batch and unbatch methods of tf.data.Datatset.

RULE: Batching followed by unbatching results in a dataset with equal
GraphTensors as before, except for the last incomplete batch (if batching
used `drop_remainder=True`).

For now, GraphTensor requires that GraphTensor.shape does not contain `None`,
except maybe as the outermost dimension. That means repeated calls to
`.batch()` must set `drop_remainder=True` in all but the last one. Future
versions of GraphTensor may lift that requirement.

All pieces and its fields are batched together with their GraphTensor so that
shapes of a graph tensor, its pieces and features are all in sync.

RULE: Batching fields with an outermost dimension of `None` turns it into a
ragged dimension of a RaggedTensor. (Note this is only allowed for the items
dimension, not a graph dimension.) In all other cases, the type of the field
(Tensor or RaggedTensor) is preserved.

<code>merge_batch_to_components() -> 'GraphTensor'
</code></pre>

Merges all contained graphs into one contiguously indexed graph.

On a batched GraphTensor, one can call this method merge all graphs of the
batch into one, contiguously indexed graph. The resulting GraphTensor has
shape [] (i.e., is scalar) and its features have the shape
`[total_num_items, *feature_shape]` where `total_num_items` is the sum of
the previous `num_items` per batch element. Most TF-GNN models expect scalar
GraphTensors. There is no function to reverse this method.


Example: Flattening of

```python
tfgnn.GraphTensor.from_pieces(
    node_sets={
        'node': tfgnn.NodeSet.from_fields(
            # Three graphs:
            #   - 1st graph has two components with 2 and 1 nodes;
            #   - 2nd graph has 1 component with 1 node;
            #   - 3rd graph has 1 component with 1 node;
            sizes=tf.ragged.constant([[2, 1], [1], [1]]),
            features={
               'id': tf.ragged.constant([['a11', 'a12', 'a21'],
                                         ['b11'],
                                         ['c11']])})},
    edge_sets={
        'edge': tfgnn.EdgeSet.from_fields(
            sizes=tf.ragged.constant([[3, 1], [1], [1]]),
            features={},
            adjacency=tfgnn.Adjacency.from_indices(
                source=('node', tf.ragged.constant([[0, 1, 1, 2],
                                                    [0],
                                                    [0]])),
                target=('node', tf.ragged.constant([[0, 0, 1, 2],
                                                    [0],
                                                    [0]]))))})
```

results in the equivalent graph of

```python

            # One graph with 4 components with 2, 1, 1, 1 nodes.

            # Note how node indices have changes to reference nodes
            # withing the same graph ignoring its components.
