<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Given a particular node set (identified by `node_set_name`), this operation
will gather the given feature from the first node of each graph component.

This is often used for rooted graphs created by sampling around the
neighborhoods of seed nodes in a large graph: by convention, each seed node is
the first node of its component in the respective node set, and this operation
reads out the information it has accumulated there. (In other node sets, the
first node may be arbitrary -- or nonexistant, in which case this operation
must not be used and may raise an error at runtime.)

The feature to fetch node values from is provided either by name (using
`feature_name`) and found in the graph tensor itself, or provided explicitly
(using `feature_value`) in which case its shape has to be compatible with the
shape prefix of the node set being gathered from. One of `feature_value`
or `feature_name` must be specified.
