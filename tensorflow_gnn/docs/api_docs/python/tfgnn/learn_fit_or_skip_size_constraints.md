<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

The function estimates the smallest possible size constraints so that a random
sample of `batch_size` graph tensors meets those constraints with probability
no less than `success_ratio`. The success ratio is treated as a hard
constraint, up to sampling error. The constraints can be used for graph tensor
padding to the fully defined shapes required by XLA.

#### Example:



```python
# Learn size constraints for a given dataset of graph tensors and the target
# batch size(s). The constraints could be learned once and then reused.
constraints = tfgnn.learn_fit_or_skip_size_constraints(dataset, batch_size)

# Batch merge contained graphs into scalar graph tensors.
if training:
  # Randomize and repeat dataset for training. Note that the fit-or-skip
  # technique is only applicable for randomizer infinite datasets. It is
  # incorrect to apply it during models evaluation because some input
  # examples may be filtered out.
  dataset = dataset.shuffle(shuffle_size).repeat()
dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)
dataset = dataset.map(lambda graph: graph.merge_batch_to_components())

if training:
  # Remove all batches that do not satisfy the learned constraints.
  dataset = dataset.filter(
      functools.partial(
          tfgnn.satisfies_size_constraints,
          total_sizes=constraints))

  # Pad graph to the learned size constraints.
  dataset = dataset.map(
      functools.partial(
          tfgnn.pad_to_total_sizes,
          size_constraints=constraints,
          validate=False))
```

The learned constraints are intend to be used only with randomized repeated
dataset. This dataset are first batched using `tf.data.Dataset.batch()`, the
batches that are too large to fit the learned contraints are filtered using
<a href="../tfgnn/satisfies_size_constraints.md"><code>tfgnn.satisfies_size_constraints()</code></a> and then padded
<a href="../tfgnn/pad_to_total_sizes.md"><code>tfgnn.pad_to_total_sizes()</code></a>.

This approach, if applicable, is more efficient compared to padding to the
maximum possible sizes. It is also simpler and faster compared to the dynamic
batching, especially for the large batch sizes (>10).  To illustrate the main
point, consider graphs containing only 0 or 1 nodes. A random batch of 1000 of
those graphs could contain 1000 nodes in the worst case. If this maximum limit
is used to reseve space for random 1000 graphs, the space of 425 nodes is used
only in 1:1000_000 cases. It is >40% more efficient to reserve space only for
575 nodes and resample batches in the rare cases when they do not fit.
