<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

The updates of EdgeSets, NodeSets and Context can either be passed as
init arguments, or constructed later by passing a deferred_init_callback,
which allows advanced users to adjust the updates to the GraphTensorSpec
of the input (which EdgeSets and NodeSets even exist).

#### Init args:


* <b>`edge_sets`</b>: A dict `{edge_set_name: edge_set_update, ...}` of EdgeSetUpdate
  layers (or custom reimplementations). They are run on the input graph
  tensor as `edge_set_update(graph, edge_set_name=edge_set_name)`.
  Their results are merged into the feature map of the respective edge set.
  This argument can be omitted, which is common in models with node set
  updates that use convolutions (i.e., read from adjacent nodes without
  computing explicit edge states).
* <b>`node_sets`</b>: A dict `{node_set_name: node_set_update, ...}` of NodeSetUpdate
  layers (or custom reimplementations). They are run on the graph tensor
  with edge set updates (if any) as
  `node_set_update(graph, node_set_name=node_set_name)`,
  Their results are merged into the feature map of the respective node set.
  This argument can be omitted (but that is uncommon).
* <b>`context`</b>: A ContextUpdate that is run on the graph tensor with edge set and
  node set updates (if any). Its results are merged back into the context
  feature map. This argument can be omitted, which is common in models
  without a context state.
* <b>`deferred_init_callback`</b>: Can be set to a function that accepts a
  GraphTensorSpec and returns a dictionary with the kwargs
  edge_sets=..., node_sets=... and context=... that would otherwise be
  passed directly at initialization time. If this argument is set,
  edge_sets, node_sets and context must all be unset.
  The object is initialized upon its first call from the results of
  the callback on the spec of the input. Before that, the object cannot
  be saved.


#### Call result:

A graph tensor with feature maps that have all configured updates merged in:
If an update returns a str-keyed dict, it gets merged into respective
feature map with the given names. If an update returns a single tensor,
the name tfgnn.HIDDEN_STATE is used.
