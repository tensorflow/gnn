<!-- Placeholder for "Used in" -->

Given a particular edge set (as identified by `edge_set_name`), this operation
collects context features from the corresponding graphs to each edge. See the
corresponding `pool_edges_to_context()` mirror operation).

The context feature to fetch values from is provided either by name (using
`feature_name`) and found in the graph tensor itself, or provided explicitly
(using `feature_value`) in which case its shape has to be compatible with the
shape prefix of the node set being gathered from. One of `feature_value` or
`feature_name` must be specified.
