  """The multi-head attention from Graph Attention Networks v2 (GATv2).

  GATv2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491) improves upon the popular
  GAT architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) by allowing the network
  to compute a more expressive "dynamic" instead of just "static" attention,
  each of whose heads is described by Equations (7), (3) and (4) in
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491.

  Example: GATv2-style attention on incoming edges whose result is
  concatenated with the old node state and passed through a Dense layer
  to compute the new node state.
  ```
  dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense
  graph = tfgnn.keras.layers.GraphUpdate(
      node_sets={"paper": tfgnn.keras.layers.NodeSetUpdate(
          {"cites": tfgnn.keras.layers.GATv2Conv(
               message_dim, receiver_tag=tfgnn.TARGET)},
          tfgnn.keras.layers.NextStateFromConcat(dense(node_state_dim)))}
  )(graph)
  ```

  This layer implements the multi-head attention of GATv2 with the following
  generalizations:
    * This implementation of GATv2 attends only to edges that are explicitly
      stored in the input GraphTensor. Attention of a node to itself is
      enabled or disabled by storing or not storing an explicit loop in the
      edge set. The example above uses a separate layer to combine the old
      node state with the attention result to form the new node state.
    * Attention values can be computed from a sender node state that gets
      broadcast onto the edge (see arg `sender_node_feature`), from an edge
      feature (see arg `sender_edge_feature`), or from their concatenation
      (by setting both arguments). This choice is used in place of the sender
      node state $h_j$ in the defining equations cited above.
    * This layer can be used with `receiver_tag=tfgnn.CONTEXT` to perform a
      convolution to the context, with graph components as receivers and the
      containment in graph components used in lieu of edges.
    * An `edge_dropout` option is provided.

  This layer can also be configured to do attention pooling from edges to
  context or to receiver nodes (without regard for source nodes) by setting
  `sender_node_feature=None` and setting `sender_edge_feature=...` to the
  applicable edge feature name (e.g., `tfgnn.DEFAULT_FEATURE_NAME`).

  Like the Keras Dense layer, if the input features have rank greater than 2,
  this layer computes a point-wise attention along the last axis of the inputs.
  For example, if the input features have shape [num_nodes, 2, 4, 1], then it
  will perform an identical computation on each of the num_nodes * 2 * 4 input
  values.

  Init args:
    num_heads: The number of attention heads.
    per_head_channels: The number of channels for each attention head. This
      means that the final output size will be per_head_channels * num_heads.
    receiver_tag: one of `tfgnn.SOURCE`, `tfgnn.TARGET` or `tfgnn.CONTEXT`.
      The results of attention are aggregated for this graph piece.
      If set to `tfgnn.SOURCE` or `tfgnn.TARGET`, the layer can be called for
      an edge set and will aggregate results at the specified endpoint of the
      edges.
      If set to `tfgnn.CONTEXT`, the layer can be called for an edge set or
      node set.
      If left unset for init, the tag must be passed at call time.
    receiver_feature: Can be set to override `tfgnn.DEFAULT_FEATURE_NAME`
      for use as the receiver's input feature to attention. (The attention key
      is derived from this input.)
    sender_node_feature: Can be set to override `tfgnn.DEFAULT_FEATURE_NAME`
      for use as the input feature from sender nodes to attention.
      IMPORANT: Must be set to `None` for use with `receiver_tag=tfgnn.CONTEXT`
      on an edge set, or for pooling from edges without sender node states.
    sender_edge_feature: Can be set to a feature name of the edge set to select
      it as an input feature. By default, this set to `None`, which disables
      this input.
      IMPORTANT: Must be set for use with `receiver_tag=tfgnn.CONTEXT`
      on an edge set.
    use_bias: If true, a bias term is added to the transformations of query and
      value inputs.
    edge_dropout: Can be set to a dropout rate for edge dropout. (When pooling
      nodes to context, it's the node's membership in a graph component that
      is dropped out.)
    attention_activation: The nonlinearity used on the transformed inputs
      before multiplying with the trained weights of the attention layer.
      This can be specified as a Keras layer, a tf.keras.activations.*
      function, or a string understood by tf.keras.layers.Activation().
      Defaults to "leaky_relu", which in turn defaults to a negative slope
      of alpha=0.2.
    activation: The nonlinearity applied to the final result of attention,
      specified in the same ways as attention_activation.
    kernel_initializer: Can be set to a `kerner_initializer` as understood
      by tf.keras.layers.Dense etc.
