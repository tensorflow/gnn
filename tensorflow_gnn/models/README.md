# TF-GNN Models

## Introduction

This directory contains a collection of GNN models implemented with the
TF-GNN library. Some of them offer reusable pieces that can be imported
_next to_ the core TF-GNN library, which effectively makes them little
libraries of their own.

### Usage

If, for example, the hypothetical FancyNet model offered a convolution
layer compatible with the standard NodeSetUpdate, its use would look like

```python
import tensorflow_gnn as tfgnn
from tensorflow_gnn.models import fancynet

_ = tfgnn.keras.layers.NodeSetUpdate(
    {"edges": fancynet.FancyConv(units=42, fanciness=0.99, ...)}, ...)
```

...and require a separate dependency for `fancynet` in a BUILD file.

### Maintenance and stability

Each model comes with a README file that lists its maintainers and the intended
level of stability and maintenance; please check before depending on it for
anything beyond one-off experimentation. In particular, the API stability
promises of TF-GNN releases do **not** extend to particular models, unless they
say so in their README files.
