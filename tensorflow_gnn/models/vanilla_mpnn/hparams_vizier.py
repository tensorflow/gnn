"""Hyperparameter search spaces for Vizier studies.

This file defines search spaces for hyperparameter tuning of the VanillaMPNN
model architecture with https://github.com/google/vizier. End-to-end models
built with VanillaMPNN can use this to configure and launch a Vizier study and
the training runs for its trials. It's up to them how to forward Vizier params
to the training script and its use of VanillaMPNN. The parameter names set
here for Vizier match the keyword arguments in the Python modeling code.

For each search space definition, this file has a function

```
add_params_<name>(search_space)
```

that modifies `search_space` in-place by adding parameters and returns `None`.
