"""Contrastive losses.

Users of TF-GNN can use these layers by importing them next to the core library:

```python
import tensorflow_gnn as tfgnn
from tensorflow_gnn.models import contrastive_losses
```
"""
from tensorflow_gnn.models.contrastive_losses import layers as perturbation_layers
from tensorflow_gnn.models.contrastive_losses import tasks
from tensorflow_gnn.models.contrastive_losses.deep_graph_infomax import layers as dgi_layers

ShuffleFeaturesGlobally = perturbation_layers.ShuffleFeaturesGlobally
DeepGraphInfomaxLogits = dgi_layers.DeepGraphInfomaxLogits
DeepGraphInfomaxTask = tasks.DeepGraphInfomaxTask
BarlowTwinsTask = tasks.BarlowTwinsTask
DeepGraphInfomaxTask = tasks.DeepGraphInfomaxTask
BarlowTwinsTask = tasks.BarlowTwinsTask
VicRegTask = tasks.VicRegTask
