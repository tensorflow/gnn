The sample is taken by going out a fixed number of steps along specific edge sets, and randomly downsampling the edges in each step if they are too numerous.\n",

In other words, the information needs to be propagated towards the `SOURCE` of each edge, so that it can reach and update the hidden state of the root. Thus, we set the `receiver_tag` to be `tfgnn.SOURCE`. An interesting observation arising from the fact that `receiver_tag=tfgnn.SOURCE` is that since the node sets `\"field_of_study\"` and `\"institution\"` have no outgoing edge sets, the `VanillaMPNNGraphUpdate` does not change their hidden states: these remain the embedding tables from node state initialization."
