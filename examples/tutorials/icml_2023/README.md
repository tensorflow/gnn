### Motivation

Graphs are general data structures that can represent information from a variety
of domains (social, biomedical, online transactions, and many more). Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) are an exciting way to use graph structured data inside
neural network models that have recently exploded in popularity. However,
implementing GNNs and running GNNs on large (and complex) datasets still raises
a number of challenges for machine learning platforms.

#### Goals

Thanks for your interest in our tutorial! The main goal of this tutorial is to
cover new capabilities present in TF-GNN v0.6. The tutorial will be based on
[TF-GNN](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn), a library for working with graph
structured data in TensorFlow.

### Additional Resources

If you're interested in learning more about GNNs or TF-GNN, we recommend the
following resources:

-   Our paper
    [*TF-GNN: Graph Neural Networks in TensorFlow*](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.03522.pdf),
    details the API design and background of the library.
-   The in-depth notebook
    [*OGBN-MAG end-to-end with TF-GNN*](https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/blob/main/examples/notebooks/ogbn_mag_e2e.ipynb)
    offers a deep dive on building heterogeneous graph models using TF-GNN.

If you're interested in other work done by the
[Graph Mining team](https://research.google/teams/graph-mining/) at Google, we
have two 'background' workshops with recorded video that cover our work:

1.  Neurips'22 Workshop on TF-GNN --
    https://github.com/tensorflow/gnn/tree/main/examples/tutorials/neurips_2022
2.  NeurIPS'20 Workshop -- https://gm-neurips-2020.github.io/
3.  ICML'22 Workshop -- https://icml.cc/Expo/Conferences/2022/talkpanel/20446
